Many of the divs found in the original index.html file were given styles in the CSS file that made each div look similar to the ones shown in the screenshot. The header was given a "container" with a gradient background that goes from left to right and has rounded corners. The main section also is a "container" with a white background and styled header fonts, hr, and lists. The link color and style were changed to match the screenshot. The quiz section contains a table where the left column has a table that contains both the title and the image and the column has the form. Each element of the table has a style that creates different row colors without making the quiz table look the same.

Some of the challenges I faced were getting the quiz section to work and making the list markers blue for the unordered list only while keeping the ordered list's markers black. I was able to google how to change the color for the unordered list's markers only, since ChatGPT wasn't providing me a working solution. For the quiz section, I tried many different ways to get the right formatting but many of them didn't work. I decided to use a table in order to get the form to the right of the "container" while still having it be left aligned. I also included a next table so that the image of the octopus could be centered based on the title and had several line breaks to get content on the left to be aligned to the right that way I desired.
